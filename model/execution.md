# Execution

The execution growth track emphasises the development of skills and expertise in technical leadership that fosters delivery of high-quality results. It focuses on the ability of each engineer to continuously improve our work and deliver high-quality results using various techniques and tools.

There are four specialisations within this growth track - ***delivery, communication, quality and optimisations***.

| | Delivery | Communication | Quality | Optimisation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | `Able to evaluate, plan and deliver wide variety of initiatives that meet their goals, timelines and budget` | `Masters the art of using tailored messages to communicate effectively with the target audience. Listens and follows-up` | `Embodies and promotes practices to ensure excellent quality products and services` | `Challenges the status quo and effects positive organisational change outside of mandated work` |
| | | | | |
| `1` | *Understands and effectively delivers individual tasks while following the squad’s best practices* | *Conveys information within the squad when called upon, and incorporates constructive feedback* | *Delivers consistently good quality work in accordance with Vio.com's quality approach and standards* | *Identifies and articulates opportunities for organisational and product improvements* |
| | Provides accurate estimations for simple tasks. | Communicates status clearly using the appropriate tools and channels. | Tests their code thoroughly according to the squad and Vio.com's quality practices. | Asks probing questions triggering conversations for optimisations. |
| | Delivers small well-scoped projects efficiently. | Seeks and applies feedback effectively. | Writes automated tests for any change or defect they deliver. | Raises valid points during squad retrospectives triggering positive change. |
| | Writes comprehensive technical documentation. | Asks for help at the appropriate juncture. | Writes clear comments and documentation. | Suggests an improvement positively affecting squad SLO/metric. |
| | | | | |
| `2` | *Understands, plans and effectively delivers small projects while following the squad’s best practices* | *Conveys information in a concise way across squads and functions, focusing on good quality conversations* | *Increases the robustness and reliability of codebases, and devotes time to improving the quality of Vio.com products* | *Implements small changes to positively impact a small feature or an individual* |
| | Investigates and writes postmortems. Implements the actions. | Uses the right channels for communication to make sure everyone is aligned. | Tests other people's code, covers edge cases and catches non-trivial issues. | Proactively picks up defects from the backlog or actions from the postmortems. |
| | Delivers moderately complex features on time. | Makes sure project stakeholders are aware of progress and bottlenecks. | Continuously refactors existing code and makes it more readable and testable. | Proactively suggests and makes design quality improvement. |
| | Balances pragmatism and perfectionism appropriately. | Practices active listening and suspension of attention. | Suggests new practices and improvements in existing ones to improve release quality. | Identifies ways to improve application performance and stability. |
| | | | | |
| `3` | *Organises a small squad (2-4 engineers) to effectively plan, estimate and deliver small projects while following the Vio.com's best practices* | *Proactively shares information, actively seeks feedback, and facilitates communication for multiple stakeholders* | *Delivers outstanding quality code and supports others in improving their work and the quality of the deliverables* | *Implements change to positively impact an entire squad or instigates a minor feature or service* |
| | Understands business needs and plans projects accordingly. | Regularly presents at tech talks, weekly demos and all hands meetings. | Regularly provides constructive feedback helping others improve the quality of their work. | Takes ownership of systems that nobody owns or wants to own. |
| | Facilitates squad rituals to deliver to the expectations. | Resolves communication issues between squads, peers and stakeholders. | Introduces new tools and practices helping the squad to improve the release quality. | Demonstrates concepts proactively with prototypes. |
| | Delegates and ensures that everyone follows squad's agreements and best practices. | Manages stakeholders and leadership expectations effectively and avoids surprises. | Identifies quality risks while implementing new features and identifies the critical paths to be tested. | Suggests a feature or component that helps optimising the product business performance. |
| | | | | |
| `4` | *Leads a large squad (7-8 engineers) or a couple of small squads to effectively plan, estimate and deliver complex projects with senior stakeholders* | *Communicates complex ideas skilfully and with nuance, and establishes alignment within the chapter* | *Ambassador of great quality deliverables, robust and reliable code. Implements processes and systems that improve quality* | *Drives and implements changes that has a substantial positive impact on the engineering chapter or a major product impact* |
| | Effectively manages cross-squad and cross-project dependencies. | Negotiates effectively on difficult topics such as resources, planning and roadmap prioritisation. | Focuses squads on the importance of quality by articulating impact and continuous feedback. | Champions new processes that help the engineering organisation perform better. |
| | Involves other functions appropriately to ensure clarification, alignment and delivery on time. | Communicates complex topics such as risk management, tradeoffs, budget and planning effectively and with nuances. | Regularly presents on quality topics in the tech talks meetings. | Exemplifies grit and determination in the face of persistent obstacles. |
| | Delivers complex loosely scoped projects on time by prioritisation and stakeholders management. | Contextualises and clarifies ambiguous direction and strategy for others. | Implements change that helps eliminating/minimising a whole class of potential defects. | Instigates major new features, services, or architectures. |
| | | | | |
| `5` | *Acts as business owner on and/or leads major company wide initiatives delivered by multiple squads* | *Influences outcomes at the highest level, manages senior stakeholders' expectations and establishes alignment across tribes and chapters* | *Quality champion. Enables and encourages the entire Vio.com to embed quality in everything we do* | *Optimisation champion. Drives and implements change that has a substantial positive impact on the entire Vio.com* |
| | Leads cross-squad projects and coordinates effective cross-functional collaboration. | Improves existing or defines existing processes for effective communication. | Defines and implements quality best practices, tools and policies across the engineering chapter. | Creates a new job function (profile) to solve systemic issues. |
| | Owns and executes key company projects affecting the total output. | Presents to execs or investors on key company plans using the right format and the right amount of info. | Ensures that everyone considers quality as a high priority activity. | Plans company wide optimisation project and executes efficiently change management. |
