# Engineering Lead

You are a senior engineer with strong and independent contribution that is willing to grow into the managerial track and has shown potential in leading people. A good start will be to take over the management of a small squad of 3-5 people with at least two people reporting directly to you.

Making the initial transition step to the managers track requires the understanding that you will have to focus on developing exceptional skills in the execution, supporting and strengthening tracks. Below is our recommendation of specialisations that will help you be an effective manager. You can chose any combination that helps you grow and meet the expectations of your squad, your manager and other stakeholders.

| Execution | Supporting | Strenghtening |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delivery 3 | Growing Together 2 | Recruiting 2 or 3 |
| Communication 2 or 3 | OrgDev 2 or 3 | Community 2 or 3 |
