### Staff Engineer

You are an established software engineer. You are extremely comfortable in your domain of expertise. You work effectively across squads and engage other functions (PO, marketing, QA) with clear messages. You are able to influence decisions and defend your proposals with arguments developed with your deep understanding of the matter.

You are a mentor to younger engineers and a source of knowledge in your domain. This is the moment when you are able to give back to the organisation by supporting others and working on large and complex (cross-squad) projects.

We still have some recommendations of areas that will help you continue your growth as an engineer but, as you are a senior professional, we expect you to pro-actively self-reflect and identify the specialisations which will help you to achieve your full potential.
